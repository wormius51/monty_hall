# monty_holl

A python script that tests the monty holl paradox.

Each function gets an array of 3 integers (representing the 3 doors in the monty holl paradox).
Each of them chooses an element. Then, an element with the value 0 is revealed.
Non Switcher stays with the same first choice and the Switcher switches after the reveal.
After 100000 rounds are over the results are printed.
